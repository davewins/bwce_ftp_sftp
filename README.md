This project shows primarily how to utilise the TIMER to schedule an FTP/sFTP file transfer.

Very simple - in this project we are just starting the timer to run once, then there is a process each for PUT/GET/LIST.

sFTP is also configured (ftp over ssh) utilising the sFTP plugin for BusinessWorks/BusinessWorks Container Edition
